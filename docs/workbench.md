# Browser workbench

The workbench is a plain HTML, CSS and browser ES-module client in `public/`. The server serves it directly; there is no frontend build step, external font, analytics dependency or browser-side token storage.

## Layout and use

Sign in with the workbench access token. The server establishes an HTTP-only session cookie. The Kameleo PAT belongs in server configuration, not this sign-in form.

The left pane lists runs and verified archives. Search matches automation titles and run identifiers. Status filters narrow the list to active runs, input requests, saved runs or failures. Selecting a run shows its browser view, activity, state and export metadata. The System panel reports engine availability and lets the operator check configured proxy inventory.

New run selects an installed automation and an interaction pace (`fast`, `natural`, or `natural-fast`). Its JSON Schema generates fields for strings, secrets, numbers, booleans, enums and nested JSON. The JSON editor also accepts object inputs that are not representable by those fields. The server remains authoritative for schema validation. Credentials are kept in form memory and cleared when the dialog closes; they are never saved to browser storage. Starting another run with the same script does not copy prior inputs.

Runs update through authenticated server-sent events, with a periodic refresh as a fallback. Pause is cooperative: the interface shows Pause requested until the script reaches a checkpoint. A script waiting for operator completion exposes Finish & save. A saved run exposes its verified `.kameleo` download and SHA-256 checksum. Failed exports expose Retry export. Cancelling a run requires confirmation because it stops active work.

If browser shutdown cannot be confirmed, the runtime quarantines the unresolved browser capacity and holds new sessions until cleanup succeeds. The finished run shows a cleanup warning, including when it failed or was cancelled. Retry export attempts shutdown again and recovers the retained profile without rerunning the automation. Interrupted runs with a known profile also expose recovery. If no profile identifier is available yet, the interface explains that the pending browser operation must settle or the engine needs inspection. The ordinary `cleanupRequired` flag on an active run is not presented as a failure; it also tracks browsers that are still running normally.

## Browser view

Snapshots are labelled still images and refresh approximately every five seconds while a selected browser is active and the tab is visible. No image or successful run is fabricated when the engine is unavailable. After a browser stops, an already-captured snapshot is labelled as the last captured image.

Connect live requests an authenticated view descriptor and imports noVNC from `/vendor/novnc/core/rfb.js`. Only a same-origin gateway WebSocket path is accepted. Any VNC password supplied by the authenticated endpoint is passed to noVNC in memory and is not stored. The client does not connect directly to a raw VNC or Kameleo endpoint.

During running automation, live view is read-only in the client to prevent accidental competing input. Keyboard and mouse input are enabled when the run is paused, awaiting input, or waiting for operator completion. This is an operator UX guard, not a security boundary: the administrator’s server session authorizes access to the whole worker display. Tenant isolation or separate viewer/controller authorization requires server support.

Fullscreen expands the selected browser stage. Resizing the viewer scales the display locally and does not change the browser screen resolution. If live-view setup is missing or unavailable, the workbench reports the error and retains snapshot access.

## UI contract

- `POST /api/login`, `GET /api/session`, `POST /api/logout`: session lifecycle.
- `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/automations`: engine and script discovery.
- `GET /api/runs`, `GET /api/runs/:id`, `POST /api/runs`: run lifecycle and selection.
- `POST /api/runs/:id/pause`, `/resume`, `/cancel`, `/finish`, `/retry-export`: operator actions.
- `POST /api/runs/:id/input`: `{ challengeId, values }` for `challenge: { id, title, fields }`, where `fields` is JSON Schema.
- `GET /api/runs/:id/screenshot`, `/artifact`, `/view`: browser snapshots, verified exports and a live-view descriptor.
- `GET /api/events`: named `run` events carrying the latest run record.
- `GET /api/proxies`, `POST /api/proxies/:id/check`: sanitized inventory and connection checks.

The frontend inserts runtime-provided text using text nodes, not HTML. It does not render inputs or returned artifact filesystem paths. API errors are presented in context. Reduced motion, keyboard focus, semantic dialog focus management, responsive layouts and labelled form controls are included.

## Visual direction

The workbench uses an operational list-and-detail layout with the browser as its central visual. Slate canvas (`#edf2f6`), blue actions (`#255f9c`), dark ink (`#203647`), teal success (`#237969`) and white surfaces keep status readable. Orange is reserved for warnings or attention. Segoe UI and native system fallbacks match a desktop workbench. Borders separate responsibilities; metrics do not occupy promotional cards.
